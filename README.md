## Getting Started

To get a copy of this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your computer.

## Step 1: Cloning the Repository
1. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository:

  **`cd /path/to/your/directory`**

2. Clone the ShoppingList repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JosefMamo12/ShoppingList.git
```

## Step 2: Setup the Server

1. Navigate to the server directory:

``` bash
cd server
```

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

``` bash
npm install
```

3. To use the application's database functionality, the client needs to create a database in their MySQL server with a specific name, let's call it 'list.' This 'list' database will be where the application stores and retrieves data.  

4. In the root folder of the server, create a .env file. This file will be used to configure the connection to your MySQL database, whether it's hosted on a cloud server or locally. <br/> Be sure to update the .env file with your MySQL database credentials."
